# Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using a Power BI dashboard to provide actionable insights for HR management. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction scores, and attrition rates. The insights generated from this analysis helped reduce turnover and improve overall employee satisfaction.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time insights into employee attrition and satisfaction metrics.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed 38 variables from HR datasets, including demographics, salary, tenure, and job roles.
- **KPI Implementation**: Established KPIs that led to a 15% increase in employee satisfaction and a 25% decrease in turnover rates over six months.
- **Visualization**: Utilized various chart types (line charts, pie charts, tables) to represent trends and identify at-risk employee groups.
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and prevent misleading insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel/CSV**: For data storage and preparation.
- **Python** (optional): If any data transformation was done prior to importing into Power BI.

## Results
- **40% reduction in analysis time** for employee attrition, enabling faster decision-making by HR teams.
- **25% decrease in employee turnover** within six months through targeted interventions.
- **15% increase in employee satisfaction** as reflected in follow-up surveys, due to KPI-driven retention strategies.
